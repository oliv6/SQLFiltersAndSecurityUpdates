<h3> SQL Filters and Security Updates - Leveraging SQL to analyze, update and report security alerts.</h3>

This project assumes myself as an a security professional at a large organization. 

Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. 

I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

My task is to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. 

I will also need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my expertise in SQL, SQL filters and applying them in retrieving specific and relevant information. 

The SQL queries, its execution and output are all put in the 'Apply filters to SQL queries' pdf file.

This was an exciting activity to perform where I was able to view and solve specific unauthorized actions took place.
